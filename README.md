# Buildnis

Distributed, platform independent build system that can handle C++20 and Fortran modules and is flexible enough to build any language and handle (almost ;) any build step imaginable.

## configure_scripts

* if `env_script` is empty, `install_path` is used, if that is empty too, it is supposed that the executable is in the PATH.
