Welcome to Buildnis' documentation!
====================================

Buildnis is a distributed, platform independent build system that can handle C++20 and
Fortran modules and is flexible enough to build any language and handle (almost ;)
any build step imaginable. It is written in Python and needs a Python interpreter, at 
least version 3.9.
